# Pi Web Gateway

Use your Pi sessions from the desktop app or a browser, locally or from another machine. Pi runs on the gateway machine with access to its filesystem, repositories, and credentials.

I have not really seen the code (this project is my first attempt to try real vibe-coding), but it works nicely!

## Install

Requirements:

- [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/)
- [Pi CLI](https://pi.dev/) available on `PATH`
- Node.js 22.12 or newer for the desktop app
- FUSE 2 for the Linux desktop app (`fuse2` on Arch Linux)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/melounvitek/pi-web-gateway.git
cd pi-web-gateway
mise trust
mise install
mise run setup
```

On first setup, save the generated admin password printed by the command.

Install the recommended desktop app on macOS or Linux:

```sh
mise run desktop-install
```

Start the gateway:

```sh
PI_GATEWAY_HOST=127.0.0.1 mise run start
```

The app connects to the running gateway and can switch between multiple gateway servers. You can also use the gateway directly at <http://localhost:4567>.

## Remote access and configuration

Do not expose the gateway directly to the public internet. Anyone with access can view sessions and start Pi processes with the gateway's filesystem and credential access.

- [Configuration options](docs/configuration.md)

## Optional Pi setup

If you do not already have a session-naming workflow, consider installing [`@furbyhaxx/pi-session-naming`](https://github.com/furbyhaxx/pi-session-naming):

```sh
pi install npm:@furbyhaxx/pi-session-naming
```

## Note

This project is written in Ruby, because I am a Ruby developer trying full vibe-coding for the first time, and I expected I might need to jump in. It turned out that was not needed, so I have mostly stayed out of the generated code -- so please, do not treat it as a sample of my usual Ruby style. It very likely is not :-).

## Development

```sh
mise run dev
mise run test
```
