# Pi Web Gateway

Browser UI for local Pi sessions.

## Requirements

- [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/)
- Pi CLI available on `PATH`

## Setup

```sh
mise trust
mise install
mise run setup
```

The setup task installs Ruby dependencies and creates a local gateway config file at `~/.config/pi-web-gateway/env` if needed. When `PI_GATEWAY_ADMIN_PASSWORD` is missing, setup generates a random admin password there and prints the file path. You can change the gateway admin password by editing that file.

## Run the gateway

```sh
mise run start
```

The gateway listens on <http://localhost:4567>.

By default, the gateway binds to `0.0.0.0`. To bind it only to a specific address, such as your Tailscale IP, pass the host as an argument:

```sh
mise run start 100.x.y.z
```

You can also configure the host or port with environment variables:

```sh
PI_GATEWAY_HOST=100.x.y.z mise run start
PI_GATEWAY_PORT=4568 mise run start
```

## Development server

```sh
mise run dev
```

## Dockerized runtime

The repository includes a portable Docker setup that runs both the gateway and the Pi CLI inside the container. The only host directory exposed to Pi is the workspace you mount at `/work`; Pi config, sessions, OAuth/API-key credentials, and gateway config persist in Docker volumes by default.

```sh
cp .env.example .env
mkdir -p workspace
# edit .env, especially PI_WORKSPACE if your code lives elsewhere
```

`.env` may contain secrets such as provider API keys and `PI_GATEWAY_ADMIN_PASSWORD`; do not commit it. You can also leave provider keys blank and authorize Pi interactively:

```sh
docker compose build
docker compose run --rm pi pi
# inside Pi, run /login and choose your provider
```

Start the browser gateway:

```sh
docker compose up gateway
```

The gateway listens on <http://localhost:4567> by default and binds to `127.0.0.1`. Set `PI_GATEWAY_BIND=0.0.0.0` only when you want remote access. If `PI_GATEWAY_ADMIN_PASSWORD` is blank, the container generates one and stores it in the `gateway_config` volume. To set your own password, put it in `.env` before starting the gateway.

To expose existing codebases, set `PI_WORKSPACE` in `.env`:

```sh
PI_WORKSPACE=/home/alice/code
```

That host directory appears as `/work` inside the container. For direct Pi use in the current repository without Compose, build the image and mount the current directory:

```sh
docker build -t pi-web-gateway:local .
docker run --rm -it \
  -v "$PWD:/work" \
  -v pi_web_gateway_pi_data:/home/piuser/.pi \
  -w /work \
  pi-web-gateway:local pi
```

Advanced users can replace the named volumes with host mounts for `~/.pi` or gateway config, but doing so reduces isolation.

## Tests

```sh
mise run test
```
