# Pi Web Gateway Usability Plan

## Goal

Turn the current Pi Web Gateway PoC into a usable personal browser UI for daily Pi sessions.

Keep the same core architecture:

- Pi remains the source of truth for sessions and messages.
- Native JSONL session files stay authoritative.
- The web gateway owns only local browser UX and Pi RPC process orchestration.
- Avoid adding a database unless a later UX requirement truly needs it.

Target experience:

> Open the local web app, browse recent sessions by working directory, switch into a conversation that opens at the bottom, read assistant markdown comfortably, see Pi/tool noise compacted by default, and chat from a Discord-like layout.

## Step delivery check

After each implementation step:

1. Run focused automated tests for the changed behavior.
2. Restart the local Sinatra/Puma server so route/view/CSS/JS changes are loaded.
3. Verify the app manually at:

> http://100.103.198.74:4567/

4. Report the exact link to open, what changed, and what to test there.

## Current baseline

The completed PoC already has:

- Session discovery from `~/.pi/agent/sessions/**/*.jsonl`.
- Sessions grouped by cwd.
- Session selection and read-only message rendering.
- One active `pi --mode rpc --session <session-file>` process.
- Prompt, abort, compact, rename, and new-session actions.
- Basic live event polling.
- Basic slash command discovery.
- No database.

## Non-goals for this usability pass

- No production packaging.
- No authentication or multi-user support.
- No full Pi TUI parity.
- No database-backed conversation cache.
- No complex multi-session background process manager unless the UX work proves one active RPC process is too limiting.

## Implementation checklist

### 1. Discord-like app shell and scrolling

- [ ] Split the page into a viewport-height app shell.
- [ ] Make the left sidebar scroll independently.
- [ ] Make the conversation/message area scroll independently.
- [ ] Keep the session header visible while reading.
- [ ] Keep the prompt composer fixed/sticky at the bottom of the conversation panel.
- [ ] Ensure opening a selected conversation scrolls to the bottom.
- [ ] Ensure live output keeps the view at the bottom when the user is already near the bottom.
- [ ] Add or update tests where practical for expected structure/classes.
- [ ] Restart server and report the test URL plus what to verify.

Success check:

- Sidebar and conversation can be scrolled separately.
- Opening a long conversation lands near the newest messages/composer.
- Sending a prompt does not require scrolling back to the input.

### 2. Sidebar session trimming and cwd navigation

- [ ] Show only the latest 5 sessions for each cwd by default.
- [ ] Keep sessions sorted newest-first inside each cwd.
- [ ] Add a simple “show all” or “show more” affordance per cwd.
- [ ] Make cwd groups visually compact and readable for long paths.
- [ ] Preserve selected-session visibility even if it is older than the latest 5.
- [ ] Add tests for default trimming and selected-session preservation.
- [ ] Restart server and report the test URL plus what to verify.

Success check:

- The sidebar is not dominated by old sessions.
- Each cwd initially shows at most 5 conversations, unless expanded.
- An older selected conversation still appears highlighted.

### 3. Message rendering structure

- [ ] Replace the single plain `<pre>` message rendering with structured message partials/helpers.
- [ ] Visually distinguish user, assistant, system/status, tool, and error output.
- [ ] Keep raw text safely escaped by default in this step.
- [ ] Add message metadata only where useful, without clutter.
- [ ] Reconcile live message rendering with the same visual structure where practical.
- [ ] Add tests for role-specific rendering/classes.
- [ ] Restart server and report the test URL plus what to verify.

Success check:

- Conversations are easier to scan.
- User and assistant messages are visually distinct.
- Live assistant output still appears correctly.

### 4. Compact expandable Pi/tool output

- [ ] Detect Pi tool/thinking/status content in historical messages where possible.
- [ ] Render noisy Pi output as compact cards by default.
- [ ] Use expandable details for full tool inputs/results/output.
- [ ] Show concise summaries such as `bash`, `read`, `edit`, or `thinking`.
- [ ] Apply similar compact rendering to live RPC events.
- [ ] Keep errors prominent and expanded enough to notice.
- [ ] Add tests for collapsed tool/thinking rendering.
- [ ] Restart server and report the test URL plus what to verify.

Success check:

- Tool and thinking noise no longer overwhelms the chat.
- Clicking/expanding reveals the full details when needed.
- Errors remain visible.

### 5. Markdown rendering for assistant messages

- [ ] Add a markdown renderer dependency.
- [ ] Add HTML sanitization for rendered markdown.
- [ ] Render assistant markdown as HTML.
- [ ] Keep user-provided content safe from raw HTML/script injection.
- [ ] Style headings, lists, links, blockquotes, inline code, and code blocks.
- [ ] Preserve readable plain-text fallback for unusual message parts.
- [ ] Add tests for markdown rendering and HTML sanitization.
- [ ] Restart server and report the test URL plus what to verify.

Success check:

- Assistant answers render lists, code blocks, and formatting nicely.
- Unsafe HTML is not executed or emitted unsanitized.
- Existing plain sessions still render cleanly.

### 6. Composer and command UX polish

- [ ] Add `Cmd/Ctrl+Enter` to send the prompt.
- [ ] Improve textarea sizing and focus behavior.
- [ ] Keep abort close to the composer while Pi is running.
- [ ] Make slash commands easier to discover without occupying too much vertical space.
- [ ] Consider lightweight slash-command filtering/autocomplete.
- [ ] Show clearer sending/running/done states.
- [ ] Add tests for rendered command UI where practical.
- [ ] Restart server and report the test URL plus what to verify.

Success check:

- Sending prompts feels fast from the keyboard.
- Commands are discoverable but not visually noisy.
- The running/abort state is clear.

### 7. Visual polish pass

- [ ] Improve spacing, typography, colors, borders, and hover states.
- [ ] Consider a dark Discord-like theme as the default.
- [ ] Add clear selected-session and active/running indicators.
- [ ] Add copy buttons for assistant messages or code blocks if simple.
- [ ] Improve empty, pending-session, and no-session states.
- [ ] Avoid large framework adoption unless the plain CSS becomes painful.
- [ ] Run the full test suite.
- [ ] Restart server and report the test URL plus what to verify.

Success check:

- The app feels comfortable enough for regular personal use.
- Important actions are easy to find.
- The UI remains simple and maintainable.

## Later ideas, not part of this pass

- Search sessions by cwd/name/message text.
- Pin or favorite sessions.
- Date separators in conversations.
- Syntax highlighting for code blocks.
- Replace polling with SSE.
- Reconcile from `get_messages` after each completed turn.
- One RPC process per open/live session if single-active-session becomes limiting.
- Attachment/image support.
